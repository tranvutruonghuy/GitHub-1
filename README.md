Please _don't_ use the SourceForge or Google Code projects any more; they are obsolete and no longer maintained.

## History
* PHPMailer was originally written in 2001 by Brent R. Matzelle as a [SourceForge project](http:/github.com).
* Marcus Bointon (coolbru on SF) and Andy Prevost (codeworxtech) took over the project in 2004.
